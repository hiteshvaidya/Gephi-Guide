    "### I Start a new project\n",
    "1. open the folder containing gephi eg. gephi-0.9.2\n",
    "2. right click and select open in terminal\\\n",
    "3. In the terminal type, `bin/gephi`\n",
    "4. The gephi window pops-up and select the option **New Project**\n",
    "  ![](images/1.png)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5. Select *File* option in the Task bar and select either of the options to open a dataset.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "6. Select one *or* multiple files in the form of *.csv* or *.xlsx* \n",
    "  ![](images/3.png)\n",

    "9. Make sure the undirected option is selected in the dropdown menu. Further the options in the radio button have following meaning:\n",
    "   - **Create multiple workspaces** - It will create a new workspace for each new .csv or .xlsx file\n",
    "   - **Merge into new workspace** - All the .csv or .xlsx files would be mereged into one new workspace\n",
    "   - **Append to existing workspace** - All the .csv or .xlsx files would be merged and added to the existing workspace. This is option is particularly useful when there is already some graph opened in the existing workspace and you want to add another graph to it.\n",
    "   - Based on your choice, you could select either of second or third radio button and then click on OK\n",
    "   <br>\n",

    "1. Make sure you have the layout window on the screen. In case, it is absent you can view it by clicking on *Window* dropdown menu in the task bar and select the layout window in this dropdown menu.\n",
    "2. Now, in the layout window select the '**Yifan Hu**' algorithm and click on Run button. You could also purturb the Yifan Hu's properties based on trial and error.\n",

    "   - To drag multiple nodes in Gephi, use the cylinder tool, which is part of the Dragging tool (Fist icon in the vertical bar).\n",
    "     - While the Dragging tool is selected, in the top left of the Graph window, next to the word \"Dragging,\" click the blue word (Configure) as shown above.\n",
    "     - Set the diameter to something greater than one, and you'll see a grey disc that allows you to drag all nodes that are within the disc.\n",
    "     - To \"close\" the tool, i.e. restore it to 1-pixel Dragging, Configure the diameter back to 1.\n",
    "   - Similarly, you can do various other operations.\n",

    "1. **Appearace**\n",
    "   - Appearance feature us used to change the size, colour and labels of nodes or edges. \n",
    "   - You can assign a single colour to all the nodes by selecting the options as shown in the following image. Please see that, to change the coolour, you must click on the square showing colour and drag to the one you want to assign to all the nodes.\n",
    "   <br>\n",

    "      - **Attention!**: please mention the colour name that you want to give to the common nodes. This program will only detect _black, <font color='blue'>blue</font>, <font color='cyan'>cyan</font>, <font color='darkgray'>darkgray</font>, <font color='gray'>gray</font>, <font color='green'>green</font>, <font color='yellow'>yellow</font>, <font color='lightgray'>lightgray</font>, <font color='magenta'>magenta</font>, <font color='orange'>orange</font>, <font color='pink'>pink</font>, <font color='red'>red</font>, white._\n",

Just copy the two lines of any other colour and replace it with your colour and paste it in the given range.\n",
